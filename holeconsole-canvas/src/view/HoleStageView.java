/**
 * HoleStageView has to create all the looks for all game elements created by the HoleStageFactory.
 * The desired UI is the following:
 * player            ╔═╗    ┏━━━┓
 *    A   B   C      ║1║    ┃ 1 ┃
 *  ╔═══╦═══╦═══╗    ╠═╣    ┣━━━┫
 * 1║   ║   ║   ║    ║2║    ┃ 2 ┃
 *  ╠═══╬═══╬═══╣    ╠═╣    ┣━━━┫
 * 2║   ║   ║   ║    ║3║    ┃ 3 ┃
 *  ╠═══╬═══╬═══╣    ╠═╣    ┣━━━┫
 * 3║   ║   ║   ║    ║4║    ┃ 4 ┃
 *  ╚═══╩═══╩═══╝    ╚═╝    ┗━━━┛
 *
 * The UI constraints are :
 *   - the main board has double-segments border, coordinates, and cells of size 2x4
 *   - the black pot has double-segments border, will cells that resize to match what is within (or not)
 *   - the red pot has simple-segment border, and cells have a fixed size of 2x4
 *
 *   main board can be instanciated directly as a ClassicBoardLook.
 *   black pot could be instanciated directly as a TableLook, but in this demo a BlackPotLook subclass is created (in case of we want to modifiy the look in some way)
 *   for red pot, a subclass RedPotLook of GridLook is used, in order to override the method that render the borders.
